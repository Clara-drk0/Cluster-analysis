**********Tercera versiÃ³n. Si la distancia entre las dos galaxias emparejadas es demasiado grande,
se asigna una galaxia vacia.
Function that extracts the unmatched galaxies from our catalogue 

Inputs: table_1 -> astropy table object that contains (at least) ra and dec coord in deg
        table_2 -> astropy table object that contains (at least) ra and dec coord in deg
        id1 -> string identifying the first table
        id2 -> string identifying the first table
        x1 -> string with the name of the table that will contain those
              elements (and their data) from table_1 that had a match in table_2
        _1 -> string with the name of the table that will contain those
              elements (and their data) from table_1 that DID NOT had a match in table_2
        x2 -> string with the name of the table that will contain those
              elements (and their data) from table_2 that had a match in table_1
        _2 -> string with the name of the table that will contain those
              elements (and their data) from table_2 that DID NOT had a match in table_1
        
Outputs: table_1,table_2 -> tables with new columns indicating the index in the other table of the element
                            matched to each row
         x1,_1,x2,_2 -> tables containing the data detailed above       
         
To improve: Check the matching. So far it matches the galaxies, but I haven't checked if the matching
            is well done. 
            ->I don't think it is completely accurate. It might have to do with the maximum distance considered for a max.
              For some galaxies it's too much and for others it's not enough.
              Maybe reformulate: find all galaxies below the maxdist and choose among them
              This last idea will imply checking individually those matched poorly.
            -> Also it should return only some kind of pointer between tables, not a hundred new tables

    #Step 1: Match according to coordinates: we estimate the distance of every element in one table to
    #        every element in the other, in case they have not been matched already (in which case 
    #        table_1[name1][j] = 1)
    #Step 2: If it has already been matched, the value assigned to the distance is our threshold, 
    #        so it can be discarded.
    #Step 3: Choose the minimum distance
    #Step 4: If the minimum distance is lower than the threshold, it's a match.
    #        Save the galaxy as matched in both tables and add the id of their couple.
